Motive & Goals
++++++++++++++

The “Molecular Pathway Discovery” is an open-source project divided in 4 pipelines:
  - Best Cutoff Algorithm (BCA)
  - Digital Pathway Curation (DPC)
  - pseudo Pathway Curation (PPC)
  - in-silico Pathway Curation (iPC)

The goal of this project is to provide a set of tools to help researchers in the field of molecular biology to discover and curate molecular pathways from high-throughput data.
