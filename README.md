# PubMed and AI

## Course in Portuguese

The "PubMed and AI" course is designed for students in Brazil. This first version is in Portuguese, and we expect to translate it into English. It begins by explaining how to use PubMed, including its limitations. The course then introduces artificial intelligence, focusing specifically on large language models (LLMs) and chatbots. Finally, it compares the results obtained from these AI tools with those from PubMed. Additionally, the course presents new websites for searching scientific biomedical terms and evaluates them against the current state-of-the-art engine and results of PubMed.
