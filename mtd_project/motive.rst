Motive & Goals
++++++++++++++

The “Molecular Pathway Discovery” is an open-source project divided in 4 pipelines:
  - Best Cutoff Algorithm (BCA)
  - Digital Pathway Curation (DPC)
  - pseudo Pathway Modulation (pPMod)
  - *in silico* Target Curation (isTC)

The goal of this project is to provide a set of tools to help researchers in molecular biology and systems biology curate pathways and suggest possible genes and molecular targets for drug discovery.

Pipelines
===========

  * Best Cutoff Algorithm (BCA)

    * Build the LFC-FDR landscape
    * Search for flexible cutoffs in high-throughput data  

  * Digital Pathway Curation (DPC)

    * Build the Ensemble Dataset

      * Calculates Gemini Reproducibility  
      * Calculate One and Multi-Model Reproducibility  
      * Find Gemini x PubMed agreements

    * Build the Multi-Source Dataset (MSD):

      * Calculates the Crowdsourcing Consensus  
      * Calculate Gemini, PubMed, and Human accuracies

  * pseudo Pathway Curation (PPC)

    * in development

  * *in silico* Target Validation (isTV)

    * in development
