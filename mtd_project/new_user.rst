New User's Project
++++++++++++++++++++

The Digital Pathway Curation (DPC) and Best Cutoff Algorithm (BCA) will soon be available for the community.

Systematically, we will document how to do it in the following months.


MTD project
==============

Currently, the MTD project is a case study using two studies as data: the COVID-19 proteomics study (by Instituto Butantan) and the Medulloblastoma microarray study (by Human Genetic Labâ€”USP Ribeirao Preto).

  * Limitations

    * Omic studies:

      * Soon after the BCA is published, we will make available a Python Library that can run any study.

    * LLM models:

      * The current version is restricted to to Gemini 1.5-pro and 1.5-flash.
      * Soon, we will generalize to any available LLM and models.
      * However, this LLM must have a web service compatible with the one described here.
      * Moreover, one must have a token to use the LLM, and many queries are usually paid.


Urgence
============
 
If you are entusiastic about the project and need to run your data, please contact us. 

However, you must share your data, and you will send the results back in a few weeks.

We are able to run a few studies in the moment.


Confidentiality
===================
 
A confidentiality agreement is part of the service. All results belong to the user; however, they are responsible for any publications and validations. We provide support without assuming any responsibility, currently without costs.
