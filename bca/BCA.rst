BCA
+++++++

``BCA`` standes for the Best Cutoff Algorithm.

Given a pre-calcualted LFC-FDR landscape, the user may defint the best cutoff parameters, manually.

This action results in new DEGs/DAPs and Enriched Pathways (denoted by the EP+Addiong pathways).

.. tip::
   This new pathways must be confirmed by the DPC pipeline.
